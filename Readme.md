# Predictive Analytics in Healthcare: Diabetes Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using clinical data. It builds a machine learning pipeline for data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, validation, and utility functions.
- `models/`: Directory to store trained models.
- `reports/`: Contains generated figures and performance reports.

## How to Run
1. Install the dependencies using `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.
2. Load and explore the data using the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.
3. Run preprocessing scripts to clean the data.
4. Train the models and evaluate their performance.
